# Simple-games-in-python
My first ever big project in python

This is my very first big project in python3 programming in class 11 with 2 other batchmates.
We made 3 simple games in this project namely **Hangman**, **TicTacToe**, and ** BlackJack **.

It helps in consolidating our concepts in python and create a firm grip over basic concepts.
